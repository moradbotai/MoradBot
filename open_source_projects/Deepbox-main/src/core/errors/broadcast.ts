/**
 * Error thrown when tensor shapes cannot be broadcast together.
 *
 * Broadcasting allows operations on tensors of different shapes by automatically
 * expanding dimensions. This error occurs when shapes are incompatible.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * // Broadcasting (3, 4) and (4,) works -> (3, 4)
 * // Broadcasting (3, 4) and (3,) fails
 * if (!canBroadcast(shape1, shape2)) {
 *   throw new BroadcastError(shape1, shape2);
 * }
 * ```
